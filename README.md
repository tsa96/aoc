# Advent of Code 2023

This is my first year doing AoC. I've made it a lot harder for myself by sometimes using languges I'm unfamiliar with - have never written a lick of Ruby, barely any Rust, and almost never use the C++ STL.

## Wall of Shame

_(every time I had to learn new stuff/get hints from Reddit)_

- Day 8: Checked other solutions whilst my bruteforce approach ran to see if it had a chance of succeeding. Turns out it did, and the smart approach only works if input data has certain properties we weren't told about, so I maintain my innocence!
- Day 17: Read up on pathfinding algorithms
- Day 18: Read up on shoestring formula after spending an hour failing to figure out a way to decompose a polygon into triangles
- Day 24: Used NumPy to solve a system of linear equations because I couldn't remember how gaussian elimination works
