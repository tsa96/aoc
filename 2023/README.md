# Advent of Code 2023

This was my first year doing AoC. I didn't worry about timing at all, and made it a lot harder for myself by often using languges I'm unfamiliar with - had never written a lick of Ruby, barely any Rust, and almost never use the C++ STL.

## Wall of Shame

_(every time I had to learn new stuff/get hints from Reddit)_

- Day 8: Checked other solutions whilst my bruteforce approach ran to see if it had a chance of succeeding. Turns out it did, and the smart approach only works if input data has certain properties we weren't told about, so I maintain my innocence!
- Day 17: Read up on pathfinding algorithms
- Day 18: Read up on shoestring formula after spending an hour writing a completely deranged algorithm to decompose a polygon into triangles. Too many edge cases!
- Day 24: Used NumPy to solve a system of linear equations because I couldn't remember how gaussian elimination works
- Day 25: Didn't do it. It's quite complex graph theory, which I've barely studied and frankly don't have any interest in. Might come back to it as a warm-up for next year, if I end up learning some theory in the meantime.
